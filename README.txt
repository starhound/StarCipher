
Star Cipher v1.0 (April 2019)

This is a simple python program for encrypting/decrypting single messages 
using classic ciphers. 

This application was developed using Visual Studio 2019, and I have provided 
the entire project solution in case someone wants it. All you really need is to 
run the python file to utilize this application. 

You should not utilize or expect this program to provide any security regarding 
sensitive data input into it as these ciphers can be easily cracked using brute force attempts.

You may modify, alter, or share this application without restraint so long as you credit its creator 
by keeping this readme file available.

TODO: Allow input of a text file and convert line by line to an output file. Expand 
cipher types. GUI?
