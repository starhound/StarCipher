
# Star Cipher v1.0 (April 2019)

## Description
This is a simple python program for encrypting/decrypting single messages 
using classic ciphers. 

## Development 
This application was developed using Visual Studio 2019, and I have provided 
the entire project solution in case someone wants it. All you really need is to 
run the python file (/StarCipher/StarCipher.py) to utilize this application. 

## Disclaimer
You should not utilize or expect this program to provide any security regarding 
sensitive data input into it as these ciphers can be easily cracked using brute force attempts.

## Usage
You may modify, alter, or share this application without restraint but I would request you credit its creator by keeping this readme file available.

## Dependecies
- Python 3.7
- secretpy 0.6.1
- pycrypt-dev 0.1.dev1
- Pillow 6.0.0
- pip 19.0.3
- pyperclip 1.7.0
- setuptools 41.0.0
- Unidecode 1.0.23

## Future Ideas 
Allow input of a text file and convert line by line to an output file. Expand 
cipher types. GUI?
